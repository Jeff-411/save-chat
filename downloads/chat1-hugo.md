## AI answer
To jump to the top or bottom of a file in Visual Studio Code, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts: For Windows and Linux:

*   Ctrl + Home: Go to the beginning of the file
*   Ctrl + End: Go to the end of the file [5](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf)

For macOS:

*   Cmd + Up Arrow: Jump to the top of the file
*   Cmd + Down Arrow: Jump to the bottom of the file [6](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67765091/jump-to-top-bottom-of-a-file-in-vs-for-mac)

These shortcuts allow for quick navigation within a file, making it easier to move between the start and end of your code or document.
