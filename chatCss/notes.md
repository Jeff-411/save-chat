# Notes: `chatCss/` 

## Naming conventions

- The prefix text indicates which html file in the `html2-chat_element/` folder is being analyzed, e.g. a `base` prefix would reference the `base.html` file [here](../html2-chat_element/single-pair/base.html)
- The prefix numbers can be read as follows:
  - The  `base0-map` file maps the direct children of, and all icons in, the Chat.
  - The subsequent numerals analyze  Chat components additively, e.g. `base2-highlight-title.css`, adds to the code in `base1-hide-icons.css`.
